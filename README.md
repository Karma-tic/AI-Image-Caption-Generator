# AI Image Caption Generator

### 🚀 Project Status: [In Progress]
*This project is part of my AI/ML internship with Evoastra. The model is currently in the training phase.*

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
To build and train a deep learning model that can generate accurate, human-like captions for any given image.

This model uses a "Show and Tell" architecture, combining:
* **CNN (InceptionV3):** To "see" the image and extract its visual features.
* **RNN (LSTM):** To "tell" the story by generating a text sequence based on those features.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow & Keras**
* **InceptionV3** (Transfer Learning)
* **LSTMs** (Natural Language Generation)
* **Google Colab** (GPU Training)
* **MS COCO Dataset**
